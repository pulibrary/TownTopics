	<h1>What is an Error?</h1>
      </header>

	<p>Errors are counted by <em>character</em>, not by
	<em>word</em>.  The following are errors:</p>

	<ol>
	  <li>Incorrect characters (e.g., <samp>c</samp> for
	  <samp>e</samp>).</li>

	  <li>Transposed characters (e.g., <samp>teh</samp> for
	  <samp>the</samp>).</li>

	  <li>Missing characters, including missing spaces (e.g.,
	  <samp>tht</samp> for <samp>that</samp> or <samp>isit</samp>
	  for <samp>is it</samp>).</li>

	  <li>Inserted characters, including spaces (e.g., <samp>c
	  at</samp> for <samp>cat</samp>).</li>
	</ol>

	<p>The following are not considered errors:</p>

	<ol>
	  <li>Differences in capitalization (e.g., <samp>pRince</samp>
	  for <samp>Prince</samp>).</li>

	  <li>Extra spaces (e.g., <pre>is    it</pre> for <samp>is
	  it</samp>.</li>

	  <li>Typographical errors present in the original.</li>
	</ol>

	<h1>Article Titles</h1>

	<p>Article titles are weighted most heavily in searching and
	so must be particularly accurate.</p>

	<ol>
	  <li>Open each article to be tested on the Historical
	  Newspapers website.  It may be faster to search for an
	  article title than navigate to it.</li>

	  <li>Check the spelling of each word in the title.  Highlight
	  errors in red.</li>

	  <li>When you have checked all titles, count the number of
	  character errors and note the total.</li>
	</ol>
