How to Install the QC Tool

1.  Install eXist.  See http://exist.sourceforge.net/ for instructions.

2.  Configure.  
    - Edit the file called build.xml in this directory. Edit
      the targets named "load-batch-04" and load-batch-05," modifying
      the dir attribute of the <fileset> element to point to the
      location of the METS files for each batch.
    - Symlink this directory to a target in $EXIST_HOME/webapp.  E.g.,
      ln -s path/to/this/dir $EXIST_HOME/webapp/

3.  Load. Start eXist, then run "ant load" from this directory.
